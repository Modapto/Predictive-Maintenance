# Predictive Maintenance Service

## Overview

This subcomponent, part of the Predictive Maintenance component, focuses on the Analysis of SEW data (CORIM file-Machine failure history, in which info related to MTBF, duration maintenance interventions, type of maintenance activity, downtime, etc.)

 ## Dataset
The dataset are manually extracted from CORIM.xlsx file provided by SEW USOCOME, then divided into 2 files: 
1. data.xlsx: Contains the parameters of the components within the production line (Alpha, Beta, Average maintenance duration).
2. activity.xlsx: Includes the parameter (Replacement time) related to maintenance activities in the production line, with each activity mapped to its corresponding component (each row of activity has the corresponding Component ID).

 ## Files Description



 ## Installation

1. Clone the repository: 
```bash    
git clone https://github.com/Modapto/Predictive-Maintenance.git
cd Predictive-Maintenance
```
2. Create, activate a virtual environment, and install the packages from the requirements.txt file:
```bash    
python -m venv virtual_env
source virtual_env/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start the application:
```bash
python GUI.py
```
2. Enter input values:
    - C_s: is the setup cost which is the same for all components which can be shared if several components are maintained together.
    - C_d: is a positive constant representing downtime cost rate related to production loss.
    - m: is the number of repairmen available in the production line.
3. User interface displays:
    - Cost saving and maintenance time window when doing group maintenance for components in production line.
    - Time and duration to do maintenance for each component.
    - Visual graph on time domain.
